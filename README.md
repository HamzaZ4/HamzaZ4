# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Hamza!

ðŸŽ“ **Engineering student at McGill University**  
ðŸ’» **Aspiring Problem Solver and ComputerPersonGuyProgrammer**

### About Me
I'm an engineering student passionate about building efficient, practical solutions through code. Iâ€™m constantly learning and adapting, with a focus on modern web technologies and solving real-world problems through software.

### What I'm Currently Learning
- **MERN Stack**: Diving deep into full-stack development with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Trying to reinforce skills in MEN, and learning the R from 0.
- **A Bit of Machine Learning**: Taking introductory course to Machine Learning to learn theory about the subject as well as experiment with libraries like pytorch and pandas.
- **Async Programming**: Mastering Promises and async/await to improve web app performance.

### Featured Projects
- **YelpyCamper**: A full-stack web app using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB for data storage. It's all about camping reviews and user feedback.
- **Simon Game**: A memory game built with vanilla JavaScript that demonstrates interactive UI design.
- **Snake Game**: A Java-based retro game built to explore object-oriented programming.

### My Stack
- **Languages**: JavaScript, Java, Python
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, EJS
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap, HTML, CSS
- **Databases**: MongoDB
- **Tools**: Git, Postman, VS Code

### Whatâ€™s Next for Me
Iâ€™m working on enhancing my full-stack projects with the MERN stack and learning about machine learning algorithms and how to apply them to real-world datasets. Iâ€™m always eager to explore new tools and improve my current projects.
